<h4><a name="changes-compared-to-avisynth" class="anchor" href="#changes-compared-to-avisynth"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h4>
<p>Download and install from the right of this page using the "Installer" link. If you already have classic AviSynth installed, switching to AviSynth+ and back is as easy as installing or uninstalling it.</p>

<h4><a name="changes-compared-to-avisynth" class="anchor" href="#changes-compared-to-avisynth"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Editing tools</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=153248">AvsPmod</a> is our recommended editor. It gives you instant preview, support for direct visual comparison, syntax highlighting, code completion, and many other features. There is currently no official release for AviSynth+, so we recommend you get it from <a href="http://www6.zippyshare.com/v/49944794/file.html">here</a> (for 32-bits). An official release which will add support for 64-bit AviSynth+ is expected soon.</li>
<li>Users of Notepad++ will be delighted that there is a <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1653824#post1653824">language add-on for AviSynth</a>.</li>
<li>And of course you can use any text editor too to edit scripts.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="changes-compared-to-avisynth" class="anchor" href="#changes-compared-to-avisynth"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional plugins</h4>
One of the strengths of AviSynth is that the community has provided a very large number of plugins for all kinds of video editing purposes.
<ul>
<li>AviSynth's official Wiki has a categorized list of scripts and plugins <a href="http://avisynth.nl/index.php/External_filters">here</a> that is most times up to date. If you're looking for filters for a specific purpose, this will be a good place to start looking.</li>
<li>Plugins for the 64-bit version are a bit more scarce. We're working on bringing 64-bit support to the most relevant plugins, until then look <a href="http://code.google.com/p/avisynth64/wiki/PluginLinks">here</a>, <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=152800">here</a> and <a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/squid_80/">here</a> for 64-bit plugins. Of course, scripts will always work on any platform as long as you have the necessary binary filters.</li>
<li>Doom9's <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/forumdisplay.php?f=33">Avisynth Usage forum</a> is probably the best place to look for the newest stuff. You'll find most new plugins in development here, as well as their support threads.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="developer-features" class="anchor" href="#developer-features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reading material</h4>
<ul>
<li>First, note that there is a lot of documentation included in your installation. In your Avisynth installation folder, you'll find examples and manuals. These will tell you about writing scripts and about various filters and their parameters.</li>
<li>The FilterSDK, also in your installation folder, contains information about writing your own binary plugins.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Main_Page">AviSynth Wiki</a> also has a large deal of information on the previous topics, and much more.</li>
<li>And last but not least, you can always ask others for help on <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/forumdisplay.php?f=67">Doom9</a>.</li>
