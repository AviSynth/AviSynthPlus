------------

CMake isn't really suited to doing header-only installs, so a GNUmakefile is
provided specifically for this purpose.

### Using GNUmakefile:

#### To install:

>make install

#### To install to a non-standard location:

>make install PREFIX=/path/to/location

#### To uninstall:

>make uninstall
